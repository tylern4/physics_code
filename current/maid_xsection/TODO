+ Fix mpintp.inc so that MAID 2003 and 2007 can be used without
  recompiling the entire project.

  How to do this:

  +1. Use very large numbers for mpintp.inc's NVAR1 and NVAR2 wherever
      they are used to create arrays.  Just has to be large enough to
      fit any possible format.
      
  +2. Set NVAR1 and NVAR2 from the input option.  Should be done in
      one of the MAID functions.

  +3. Add MAID 2003 and MAID2007 options to the maid_lee.F file.

  +4. Use NVAR1  = 81 , NVAR2 = 91 for MAID2000 and MAID2003

  +5. Use NVAR = 101, NVAR2 = 93 for MAID2007
