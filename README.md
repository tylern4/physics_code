#Physics Research Code

This it my physics research code repo. It's mainly to help me organize and backup my code as well as have branches
that will run and compile on my OSX vs linux systems. The main code can be found in the `current` folder with other
folders for different parts of the code or useful scripts.  The main dependency is [cern root](https://root.cern.ch)
and I usually use the root [github repo](https://github.com/root-mirror/root) to get the latest version.


## Compile and run
All code is in the `current` folder. Inside current there is a cpp analysis program, a cpp skim program and an attempt at a python analysis program.
To make either the cpp or skim program go into the folder and run make. The python program uses a root macro which is compiled using the `comile_root` script in the `physics_code/scripts` folder.
