#Physics Research Code
---

This it my physics research code repo. It's mainly to help me organize and backup my code as well as have braches
that will run and comile on my OSX vs linux systems. The main code can be found in the `current` folder with other 
folders for different parts of the code or useful scripts.  The main dependancy is [cern root](https://root.cern.ch)
and I usualy use the root [github repo](https://github.com/root-mirror/root) to get the latest version.
