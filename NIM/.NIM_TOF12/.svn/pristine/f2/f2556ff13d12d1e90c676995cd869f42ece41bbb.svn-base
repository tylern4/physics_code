\subsection{Final implementation of shielding with overhang}
To also preserve the signal amplitude in the longitudinal orientation, it was decided that in the final implementation, the external shielding would extend a few centimeters beyond the front face of the PMT ($\defeq$ overhang). This requires shaving two edges of the scintillator bars by a few millimeters. Tab. 4 shows the results of testing the signal reduction at various overhang positions of the external shielding. The overhang position of $4\;cm(1.5\;in)$ is sufficient to preserve the signal up to $30\;G$ in the longitudinal orientation.
