The primary electronic subsystem components relevant to FTOF12 time resolution are discriminators, time-to-digital converters (TDC), and charge-to-digital converters (QDC).  Each anode PMT pulse of sufficient amplitude generates a logic signal by way of a discriminator, and the logic signal's time of arrival is measured by a TDC.  In parallel, the corresponding dynode PMT pulse is integrated by a QDC.  In the case of FTOF12's fixed-risetime PMT signals, the time required for the incoming signal to reach the discriminator threshold (timewalk) can be subtracted according to the signal size, which is proportional to the corresponding QDC value.  The TDC sets the fundamental lower limit on the time resolution measurement, the discriminator introduces time variations primarily through timewalk, and the QDC provides information that allows for timewalk correction.  Accordingly, the properties of each of these components are crucial to achieving optimal time resolution.
