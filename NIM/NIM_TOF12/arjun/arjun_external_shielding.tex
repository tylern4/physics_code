\subsubsection{External shielding}
In order to provide additional shielding, a rectangular external mu-metal shielding, with each side of thickness $2\;mm$, was designed. Tab. 2 shows that within this external shielding, in the transverse orientation, the signal amplitude is preserved up to $30\;G$. However, this provided no additional protection to PMT in the longitudnal orientation.
