Discriminators generate logic signals whenever incoming analog signals rise above a preset threshold voltage.  Two classes of discriminators are common:  constant fraction discriminators (CFD) and leading edge discriminators (LED).  CFDs are designed to correct for timewalk by triggering on the sum of the incoming signal and a delayed, attenuated, and inverted duplicate.  LEDs trigger directly on the incoming signal.  Properly tuned CFDs were sufficient for previous time-of-flight applications, but FTOF12 is sensitive to an additional QDC-based timewalk correction to CFD-triggered signals.  Since these additional timewalk corrections would be required in either case, the simpler and less expensive LEDs were used.

In the case of LEDs, the threshold voltage must be optimized to minimize background, maximize good signal acceptance, and reduce time jitter introduced by fine-grained random volage fluctuations.

[TODO: add LED threshold results and discussion!]
