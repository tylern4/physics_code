- Spell out combinations in symmetry table

+ 12 equations should be 2 columns of 6 equations for overconstrained

- Equation numbers

- Comma not colon on overconstrained matrix

+ At end of section show application of technique, include plot of 3
  bar combinations and individual bars on same plot with two x axes (one
  for individual, one for 3 bar)

+ Include normal, complementary, and combined analyses for one, maybe
  two sets, one for large fluctuations, one for small fluctuations.

NEEDS PDF GENERATED:- No database entry for mu metal graph

+ See if we can have a single flowchart for shipping procedures (PMT,
  Scintillator, and mu metal shielding).
