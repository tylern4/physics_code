\subsection{Results and Conclusions}
With the finally designed and implemented shielding, the time resolution of the panel-1b FTOF counters remains unaffected by the presence of fringe magnetic fields in CLAS12 up to a field level of at least $XX\;G$ and $YY\;G$ in the transverse and longitudinal orientations, respectively. This exceeds the maximum field of $22\;G$ (of which 2/3 will be in longitudinal direction) to which the panel-1b PMTs are expected to be exposed to.
