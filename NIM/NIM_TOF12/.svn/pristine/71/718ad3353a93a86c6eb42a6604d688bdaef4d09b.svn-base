\subsection{... threshold dependence}
We also compared various threshold (\textit{Define "threshold"}) levels for the signals from the PMT and see if it had any affect on the time resolution. The threshold levels tried were:50mV, 75mV, 150mV, 300mV, and 600mV.

Following is a figure that demonstrates varying the threshold did not affect the time resolution.
