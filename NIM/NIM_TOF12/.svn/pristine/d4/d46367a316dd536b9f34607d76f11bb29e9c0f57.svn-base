\section{
J Cables}

The primary concerns regarding choice of cable type are cost, space, and impact on time
resolution. Low-attenuation cables that maintain signal integrity over long distances cost
more and occupy more space. And the fast timing of signals from the FTOF system requires cables with low signal distortion also. With the cables of 768 PMTs~\cite{FToF12} being routed between the layers
and panels of the detector, the extra volume of bundled cables is a serious concern, so barring
an impact on time resolution, the thinner and less expensive RG58 cables are preferred.
The distortion and attenuation of signals through five different types of cable was investigated, including specification measurements of signal speed, attenuation, and rise time, which were all listed in the Table~\ref{T:table4}. After choosing the RG58 cable, the rise time and amplitude of the signal with RG58 cable length varied from $100\;ft$ to $500\;ft$ were measured, and the results are shown in Table~\ref{T:table6}.

Additionally, and most importantly, the time resolution tests were performed for various
lengths of cable RG58. The results are shown in Table~\ref{T:table5}, the time resolution does not change to bad even for $100$ feet-long cable. And with the digitization electronics at the panel edges, the
maximum cable lengths would be under 21 ft, for which RG58 is still well-suited.
